# Databases
## Config.db
Always located at `CommandCoin$\data\Config.db`.
Contains data needed for the program to run like important data or references and api keys.

### Tables
List of tables of the database.

#### settings 
Contains user-configurable options that modify program behavior.
These represent adjustable choices (currency, theme, rules).
| Column  | Type | Description    | Example                |
|---------|------|----------------|------------------------|
| Setting | TEXT | primary key    | auto_update, use rule1 |
| Value   | TEXT | setting value  | true, 1                |

#### data
Contains essential data required by the program.
Unlike settings, these values aren't meant for user configuration.
| Column  | Type | Description    | Example                  |
|---------|------|----------------|--------------------------|
| Name    | TEXT | primary key    | BBVA_api_key, start_date |
| Value   | TEXT | setting value  | 0absd0123, 12/03/2022    |

## CommandCoin$.db
Default path is `CommandCoin$\data\CommandCoin$.db`.
The path can be changed to any preferred path.
The path is saved in the data table in the Config database. 
Contains all the user data.
Non global settings are stored here (Accounts and Wallets settings). 

### Data structure
```
Accounts 
├── Settings  
└── Wallets
    ├── Settings 
    └── Dates 
        └── Expenses
            └── Tags
```
Accounts represent each bank account
Wallets divide your bank account into founds for different purposes.
For example you might want to divide your money into needs and wants etc. 
Each wallet contains a list of dates, each time you add a purchase or a transaction it will be stored in the corresponding date.
Each transaction contains a list of tags that identify better the transaction. 

#### ID
Ids are incremental and immutable.
Ids all start from 0.
Ids are auto incremented. 
Id structure : [x.y.z.w]
- x : Account Id.
Incremented by 1 each time one is created
- y : Wallet Id.
Incremented by 1 each time one is created
- z : Date Id.
The starting date is saved in Config\data as date 0.
The id of the date is incremented each day by 1. 
Negative dates are possible.
- w : Expense Id.
Incremented by 1 each time one is created
